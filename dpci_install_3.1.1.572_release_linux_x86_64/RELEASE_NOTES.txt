INSTALLATION
------------
1.  Serial port configuration

The DirectPCI SDK & Run-time package includes a driver called dpci_serial.
This is only required for the DPX-E120, DPX-E105 and DPX-C705.  All DPX-S
series boards and other DPX-E and DPX-C series boards have multi-port serial
chips which require separate software support available from our knowledge-base
website at http://www.advantech-innocore.com/support/.

Some Linux distirbutions have their kernels configured with a small default
number of serial ports, which is certainly insufficient whichever DPX-series
mainboard you are using.  In many cases it is sufficient to add the following
configuraiton settings in modules.conf or in grub.conf.

	 8250.nr_uarts=12 8250.share_irq=1

If these setting are not effective using modules.conf or grub.conf then you
will need to reconfigure your kernel.  You will need to set the parameter
CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_NR_UARTS to 8 (for the 80-1003 board) or 12 (for the 80-0062 board) for kernels with the 8250 driver built in.

You should consider setting this up first before running the dpci installer as
the installer may appear to fail installing the dpci_serial driver, although it
actually has succeeded and the install continues.


2.  Installation on Older Ubuntu Distributions

For such versions older then 10.04, we strongly suggest you upgrade to 10.04 or a newer release.

For versions older than 8.04.4, please contact us.  You will require a glib
v2.3-compatible build which may require additional engineering work and thus an
engineering charge.

Under Ubuntu 5.10, the Kernel Makefile in /lib/modules/2.6.12-9-386/build is
missing a suitable setting for EXTRAVERSION; this means that when DirectPCI is
installed, the kernel modules are built and installed incorrectly and so do not
load.  You must modify this so that EXTRAVERSION is set to -9-386 thus:

   PATCHLEVEL = 6
   SUBLEVEL = 12
-> EXTRAVERSION = -9-386
   NAME=Woozy Numbat

If you have updated to the 2.6.12-10-386 kernel then use the setting -10-386.

Under Ubuntu, you must also have the following packages installed:

* setserial -  so serial ports are installed with correct device numbers.
* linux-headers package for the version of the kernel you're using; if these
  are not available then it will not be possible to install the drivers.
* gcc and make - you will need these and other development tools installed.

Under Ubuntu 7.10, a similar problem occurs because although the kernel version
named 2.6.22-14-generic, the build makefile says 2.6.22.9.  As such, the DPCI
driver installation will fail because the new module could not be loaded.
However, the modules do compile and load.  To fix this run the following command
as superuser (root) after installation:

   # cd /lib/modules/2.6.22.9
   # mv extra ../2.6.22-14-generic

3. Digital Input Ports and Interrupts

The interrupts caused by Input port 0 on the 80-1003 I/O board, digital input
port 0 on the DPX-116U, and all input ports on the 80-0062 I/O board II and the
DXP-112, are relayed as input on /dev/input/eventX, where X is an integer,
normally 1 or 2, depending upon whether a pointing device is also installed.
Your kernel must have the event logging system enabled (CONFIG_INPUT_EVDEV is
set to 'm' or 'y').  At boot time you will need to ensure that the evdev module
is loaded if it has not been compiled into the kernel directly.

The input device name "/dev/input/dpci" can be used (as expected by the
dpci_test demo in /usr/local/src/denistron/demo/dpci_core) so that the device
name remains the same even if additional input devices are installed. To do
this modify the udev.rules file in /etc/udev/rules.d so that an additional
line (prefixed '+') is placed for input devices thus.

 # input devices
 KERNEL="mice",          NAME="input/%k"
 KERNEL="mouse*",        NAME="input/%k"
+KERNEL="event*", SYSFS{vendor}="0x16cd", NAME="input/%k", SYMLINK="input/dpci"
 KERNEL="event*",        NAME="input/%k"
 KERNEL="js*",           NAME="input/%k"
 KERNEL="ts*",           NAME="input/%k"

Some newer udev releases use the wildcard "event[0-9]*" instead of "event*" as shown above, they also use the == operator; in such cases use the extra line
marked by '+' below:

 KERNEL=="mouse*",        NAME="input/%k"
+KERNEL=="event*", SYSFS{vendor}=="0x16cd", NAME="input/%k", SYMLINK="input/dpci"
 KERNEL=="event*",        NAME="input/%k"
